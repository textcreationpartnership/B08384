         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </item>
                  <item>2 That thoſe two great Ordinances of Magiſtracy and Miniſtery may be brought forth in their truth and beauty, diſtinguiſhed from the counterfeits of them, by pouring forth more anointing to thoſe offices, by which it may be demonſtrated that the ſufficiency of both is only of and from the Lord, and that he may in all humility and fear be appealed unto, for a gracious deciſion in this day of the worlds rage, and accuſing his poor people for being againſt Magiſtracy and Miniſtery, whether the accuſed or accuſers are moſt for that which he will own.</item>
                  <item>3 That thoſe of the Army and their adherents who have been ſo forcely viſited by the Lord, and whoſe affliction is like to be helped forward, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to by unreaſonable and cruel revilers, might have that diſpenſation of his, ſo ſanctified to them, as might tend effectually to renew them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, for their great Apoſtacy and treacherous dealing with the Lord his cauſe and people, that ſo the Lord in mercy might put a checque to the boundleſs rage of the enemy, and avenger, and in due time reprove their inſulting Reprovers.</item>
                  <item>4 That in this day of ſo eminent a ſayler of the viſible protection of his poor peeled people, he might be earneſtly ſought unto, and found to bee their ſure defence, and yet again this ſong might be in their mouths, <hi>SAL<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ATION IS OF THE LORD, HIS BLESSING IS <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>PON HIS PEOPLE,</hi> and it might be known to the ends of the earth, <hi>that there is no inchantment againſt</hi> Jacob, neither is there any divination againſt <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
